    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Predictive Control with Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency."
